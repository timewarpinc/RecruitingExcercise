# Recruiting Excercise

Hi!

This very barebones example project based on an example scene of [Edgar-Unity](https://github.com/OndrejNepozitek/Edgar-Unity) project.

## Task

Implement Fog of War. The scene is `Assets/Dungeon/Dungeon.unity`.

* You should see black tiles initially.
* As you move you should uncover the real dungeon.

If you want to show off, you can also consider following:

* Dim area you discovered, but not currently standing in. 
* Correctly uncover the fog just 1 tile behind any wall tile.
* Uncover the whole room once the player enters.
* Have two levels of uncovering (more dimmed and less).
* Uncover with animation.

## Rules

There isn't many rules.

* Treat this as production project.
* We would like Git history.
* You can change rendering pipeline.
* Send us the project including Git history.
* Do not fork into a public project on GitHub.
* Contact us when in doubt.
* This should take you just a few hours at maximum.

Enjoy!
